<title>The Oxen and the Wheels</title>
<h1>The Oxen and the Wheels
<h2></h1>From Aesop's Fables</h2>
<p>
A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a
miry country road. They had to use all their strength to pull
the wagon, but they did not complain.
<p>
<p>
The wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the
task they had to do was very light compared with that of the
Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen,
pulling with all their might to draw the wagon through the
deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of
the Wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work so
much the harder to endure.
</p>
<h2>
They complain most who suffer least.
